<h3>Full scene antialiasing</h3>
<p>Antialiasing is a technique used to smooth the edges of objects
in a scene to reduce the jagged "stairstep" effect that sometimes
appears. By setting the appropriate environment variable, you can
enable full-scene antialiasing in any OpenGL application on these
GPUs.</p>
<p>Several antialiasing methods are available and you can select
between them by setting the __GL_FSAA_MODE environment variable
appropriately. Note that increasing the number of samples taken
during FSAA rendering may decrease performance.</p>
<p>To see the available values for __GL_FSAA_MODE along with their
descriptions, run:</p>
<pre class="screen">
    nvidia-settings --query=fsaa --verbose
</pre>
<p>The __GL_FSAA_MODE environment variable uses the same integer
values that are used to configure FSAA through nvidia-settings and
the NV-CONTROL X extension. In other words, these two commands are
equivalent:</p>
<pre class="screen">
    export __GL_FSAA_MODE=5

    nvidia-settings --assign FSAA=5
</pre>
<p>Note that there are three FSAA related configuration attributes
(FSAA, FSAAAppControlled and FSAAAppEnhanced) which together
determine how a GL application will behave. If FSAAAppControlled is
1, the FSAA specified through nvidia-settings will be ignored, in
favor of what the application requests through FBConfig selection.
If FSAAAppControlled is 0 but FSAAAppEnhanced is 1, then the FSAA
value specified through nvidia-settings will only be applied if the
application selected a multisample FBConfig.</p>
<p>Therefore, to be completely correct, the nvidia-settings command
line to unconditionally assign FSAA should be:</p>
<pre class="screen">
    nvidia-settings --assign FSAA=5 --assign FSAAAppControlled=0 --assign FSAAAppEnhanced=0
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>The driver may not be able to support a particular FSAA mode for
a given application due to video or system memory limitations. In
that case, the driver will silently fall back to a less demanding
FSAA mode.</p>
<h3>Fast approximate antialiasing (FXAA)</h3>
<p>Fast approximate antialiasing is an antialiasing mode supported
by the NVIDIA graphics driver that offers advantages over
traditional multisampling and supersampling methods. This mode is
incompatible with UBB, triple buffering, and other antialiasing
methods. To enable this mode, run:</p>
<pre class="screen">
 nvidia-settings --assign FXAA=1
</pre>
<p>nvidia-settings will automatically disable incompatible features
when this command is run. Users may wish to disable use of FXAA for
individual applications when FXAA is globally enabled. This can be
done by setting the environment variable __GL_ALLOW_FXAA_USAGE to
0. __GL_ALLOW_FXAA_USAGE has no effect when FXAA is globally
disabled.</p>
<h3>Anisotropic texture filtering</h3>
<p>Automatic anisotropic texture filtering can be enabled by
setting the environment variable __GL_LOG_MAX_ANISO. The possible
values are:</p>
<div class="informaltable">
<table summary="(no summary available)" border="0">
<colgroup>
<col>

<h3>Vblank syncing</h3>
<p>The __GL_SYNC_TO_VBLANK (boolean) environment variable can be
used to control whether swaps are synchronized to a display
device's vertical refresh.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Setting __GL_SYNC_TO_VBLANK=0 allows glXSwapBuffers to swap
without waiting for vblank.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setting __GL_SYNC_TO_VBLANK=1 forces glXSwapBuffers to
synchronize with the vertical blanking period. This is the default
behavior.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>When sync to vblank is enabled with TwinView, OpenGL can only
sync to one of the display devices; this may cause tearing
corruption on the display device to which OpenGL is not syncing.
You can use the environment variable __GL_SYNC_DISPLAY_DEVICE to
specify to which display device OpenGL should sync. You should set
this environment variable to the name of a display device; for
example "CRT-1". Look for the line "Connected display device(s):"
in your X log file for a list of the display devices present and
their names. You may also find it useful to review <a href=
"configtwinview.html" title=
"Chapter&nbsp;12.&nbsp;Configuring Multiple Display Devices on One X Screen">
Chapter&nbsp;12, <i>Configuring Multiple Display Devices on One X
Screen</i></a> "Configuring Twinview" and the section on Ensuring
Identical Mode Timings in <a href="programmingmodes.html" title=
"Chapter&nbsp;18.&nbsp;Programming Modes">Chapter&nbsp;18,
<i>Programming Modes</i></a>.</p>
<p>If a display device is being provided by a synchronized RandR
1.4 Output Sink, it will not be listed under "Connected display
device(s):", but can still be used with __GL_SYNC_DISPLAY_DEVICE.
The names of these display devices can be found using the
<code class="computeroutput">xrandr</code> command line tool. See
<a href="randr14.html#randr14sync" title=
"Synchronized RandR 1.4 Outputs">Synchronized RandR 1.4 Outputs</a>
for information on synchronized RandR 1.4 Output Sinks.</p>
<h3>Controlling the sorting of OpenGL FBConfigs</h3>
<p>The NVIDIA GLX implementation sorts FBConfigs returned by
glXChooseFBConfig() as described in the GLX specification. To
disable this behavior set __GL_SORT_FBCONFIGS to 0 (zero), then
FBConfigs will be returned in the order they were received from the
X server. To examine the order in which FBConfigs are returned by
the X server run:</p>
<pre class="screen">
nvidia-settings --glxinfo
</pre>
<p>This option may be be useful to work around problems in which
applications pick an unexpected FBConfig.</p>
<h3>OpenGL yield behavior</h3>
<p>There are several cases where the NVIDIA OpenGL driver needs to
wait for external state to change before continuing. To avoid
consuming too much CPU time in these cases, the driver will
sometimes yield so the kernel can schedule other processes to run
while the driver waits. For example, when waiting for free space in
a command buffer, if the free space has not become available after
a certain number of iterations, the driver will yield before it
continues to loop.</p>
<p>By default, the driver calls sched_yield() to do this. However,
this can cause the calling process to be scheduled out for a
relatively long period of time if there are other, same-priority
processes competing for time on the CPU. One example of this is
when an OpenGL-based composite manager is moving and repainting a
window and the X server is trying to update the window as it moves,
which are both CPU-intensive operations.</p>
<p>You can use the __GL_YIELD environment variable to work around
these scheduling problems. This variable allows the user to specify
what the driver should do when it wants to yield. The possible
values are:</p>
<div class="informaltable">
<table summary="(no summary available)" border="0">
<colgroup>
<col>
<col></colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>__GL_YIELD</th>
<th>Behavior</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&lt;unset&gt;</td>
<td>By default, OpenGL will call sched_yield() to yield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"NOTHING"</td>
<td>OpenGL will never yield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"USLEEP"</td>
<td>OpenGL will call usleep(0) to yield.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p></p>
<h3>Controlling which OpenGL FBConfigs are available</h3>
<p>The NVIDIA GLX implementation will hide FBConfigs that are
associated with a 32-bit ARGB visual when the
XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS environment variable is defined. This
matches the behavior of libX11, which will hide those visuals from
XGetVisualInfo and XMatchVisualInfo. This environment variable is
useful when applications are confused by the presence of these
FBConfigs.</p>
<p><a name="unofficialprotoenv" id="unofficialprotoenv"></a></p>
<h3>Using Unofficial GLX protocol</h3>
<p>By default, the NVIDIA GLX implementation will not expose GLX
protocol for GL commands if the protocol is not considered
complete. Protocol could be considered incomplete for a number of
reasons. The implementation could still be under development and
contain known bugs, or the protocol specification itself could be
under development or going through review. If users would like to
test the client-side portion of such protocol when using indirect
rendering, they can set the __GL_ALLOW_UNOFFICIAL_PROTOCOL
environment variable to a non-zero value before starting their GLX
application. When an NVIDIA GLX server is used, the related X
Config option <a href=
"xconfigoptions.html#AllowUnofficialGLXProtocol">AllowUnofficialGLXProtocol</a>
will need to be set as well to enable support in the server.</p>
<h3>Overriding driver detection of SELinux policy booleans</h3>
<p>On Linux, the NVIDIA GLX implementation will attempt to detect
whether SELinux is enabled and modify its behavior to respect
SELinux policy. By default, the driver adheres to SELinux policy
boolean settings at the beginning of a client process's execution;
due to shared library limitations, these settings remain fixed
throughout the lifetime of the driver instance. Additionally, the
driver will adhere to policy boolean settings regardless of whether
SELinux is running in permissive mode or enforcing mode. The
__GL_SELINUX_BOOLEANS environment variable allows the user to
override driver detection of specified SELinux booleans so the
driver acts as if these booleans were set or unset. This allows the
user, for example, to run the driver under a more restrictive
policy than specified by SELinux, or to work around problems when
running the driver under SELinux while operating in permissive
mode.</p>
<p>__GL_SELINUX_BOOLEANS should be set to a comma-separated list of
key/value pairs:</p>
<pre class="screen">
 __GL_SELINUX_BOOLEANS="key1=val1,key2=val2,key3=val3,..."
</pre>
<p>Valid keys are any SELinux booleans specified by "getsebool -a",
and valid values are 1, true, yes, or on to enable the boolean, and
0, false, no, or off to disable it. There should be no whitespace
between any key, value, or delimiter. If this environment variable
is set, the driver assumes that SELinux is enabled on the system.
Currently, the driver only uses the "allow_execmem" and
"deny_execmem" booleans to determine whether it can apply
optimizations that use writable, executable memory. Users can
explicitly request that these optimizations be turned off by using
the __GL_WRITE_TEXT_SECTION environment variable (see <a href=
"openglenvvariables.html#disableexecmem" title=
"Disabling executable memory optimizations">Disabling executable
memory optimizations</a> below). By default, if the driver cannot
detect the value of one or both of these booleans, it assumes the
most permissive setting (i.e. executable memory is allowed).</p>
<h3>Limiting heap allocations in the OpenGL driver</h3>
<p>The NVIDIA OpenGL implementation normally does not enforce
limits on dynamic system memory allocations (i.e., memory allocated
by the driver from the C library via the malloc(3) memory
allocation package). The __GL_HEAP_ALLOC_LIMIT environment variable
enables the user to specify a per-process heap allocation limit for
as long as libGL is loaded in the application.</p>
<p>__GL_HEAP_ALLOC_LIMIT is specified in the form BYTES SUFFIX,
where BYTES is a nonnegative integer and SUFFIX is an optional
multiplicative suffix: kB = 1000, k = 1024, MB = 1000*1000, M =
1024*1024, GB = 1000*1000*1000, and G = 1024*1024*1024. SUFFIX is
not case-sensitive. For example, to specify a heap allocation limit
of 20 megabytes:</p>
<pre class="screen">
__GL_HEAP_ALLOC_LIMIT="20 MB"
</pre>
<p>If SUFFIX is not specified, the limit is assumed to be given in
bytes. The minimum heap allocation limit is 12 MB. If a lower limit
is specified, the limit is clamped to the minimum.</p>
<p>The GNU C library provides several hooks that may be used by
applications to modify the behavior of malloc(3), realloc(3), and
free(3). In addition, an application or library may specify
allocation symbols that the driver will use in place of those
exported by libc. Heap allocation tracking is incompatible with
these features, and the driver will disable the heap allocation
limit if it detects that they are in use.</p>
<p>WARNING: Enforcing a limit on heap allocations may cause
unintended behavior and lead to application crashes, data
corruption, and system instability. ENABLE AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>
<h3>OpenGL Shader Disk Cache</h3>
<p>The NVIDIA OpenGL driver utilizes a shader disk cache. This
optimization benefits some applications, by reusing shader binaries
instead of compiling them repeatedly. The related environment
variables __GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE and __GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_PATH,
as well as the GLShaderDiskCache X configuration option, allow
fine-grained configuration of the shader cache behavior. The shader
disk cache:</p>
<div class="orderedlist">
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>is always disabled for indirect rendering</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is always disabled for setuid and setgid binaries</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by default, is disabled for direct rendering when the OpenGL
application is run as the root user</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by default, is enabled for direct rendering when the OpenGL
application is run as a non-root user</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>The GLShaderDiskCache X configuration option forcibly enables or
disables the shader disk cache, for direct rendering as a non-root
user.</p>
<p>The following environment variables configure shader disk cache
behavior, and override the GLShaderDiskCache configuration
option:</p>
<div class="informaltable">
<table summary="(no summary available)" border="0">
<colgroup>
<col>
<col></colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Environment Variable</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>__GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE (boolean)</td>
<td>Enables or disables the shader cache for direct rendering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>__GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_PATH (string)</td>
<td>Enables configuration of where shader caches are stored on
disk.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>If __GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_PATH is unset, caches will be stored
in $XDG_CACHE_HOME/.nv/GLCache if XDG_CACHE_HOME is set, or in
$HOME/.nv/GLCache if HOME is set. If none of the environment
variables __GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_PATH, XDG_CACHE_HOME, or HOME is
set, the shader cache will be disabled. Caches are persistent
across runs of an application. Cached shader binaries are specific
to each driver version; changing driver versions will cause
binaries to be recompiled.</p>
<h3>Threaded Optimizations</h3>
<p>The NVIDIA OpenGL driver supports offloading its CPU computation
to a worker thread. These optimizations typically benefit
CPU-intensive applications, but may cause a decrease of performance
in applications that heavily rely on synchronous OpenGL calls such
as glGet*. They are enabled by default on Linux (under certain
conditions), but will self-disable if they are not increasing
performance.</p>
<p>Setting the __GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS environment variable to
"1" before loading the NVIDIA OpenGL driver library will force (if
the requirements covered below are met) these optimizations to be
enabled for the lifetime of the application, with no self-disable
possible. This is how the driver has historically behaved since
threaded optimizations (disabled by default) were introduced. It is
not advised to force these optimizations enabled. Relying on the
automated mechanism is preferable. Setting the variable to "0" will
force these optimizations to be disabled. Not setting the variable
at all will attempt to enable the optimizations, but with the
self-disabling mechanism activated. This mechanism is, among the
Unix platforms supported by the NVIDIA driver, only functional on
Linux. Where it is not functional, the optimizations are disabled
by default.</p>
<p>Please note that these optimizations will only work if the
target application dynamically links against pthreads. If this
isn't the case, the dynamic loader can be instructed to do so at
runtime by setting the LD_PRELOAD environment variable to include
the pthreads library.</p>
<p>Additionally, these optimizations require Xlib to function in
thread-safe mode. The NVIDIA OpenGL driver cannot reliably enable
Xlib thread-safe mode itself, therefore the application needs to
call XInitThreads() before making any other Xlib call. Otherwise,
the threaded optimizations in the NVIDIA driver will not be
enabled.</p>
<h3>Conformant glBlitFramebuffer() scissor test behavior</h3>
<p>This option enables the glBlitFramebuffer() scissor test, which
must be enabled for glBlitFramebuffer() to behave in a conformant
manner. Setting the __GL_ConformantBlitFramebufferScissor
environment variable to 0 disables the glBlitFramebuffer() scissor
test, and setting it to 1 enables it. By default, the
glBlitFramebuffer() scissor test is enabled.</p>
<p>Some applications have bugs which cause them to not display
properly with a conformant glBlitFramebuffer(). See <a href=
"knownissues.html" title=
"Chapter&nbsp;9.&nbsp;Known Issues">Chapter&nbsp;9, <i>Known
Issues</i></a> for more details.</p>
<h3>G-SYNC</h3>
<p>When a G-SYNC-capable monitor is attached, this option controls
whether G-SYNC, also called &ldquo;<span class="quote">variable
refresh rate</span>&rdquo;, can be used. Setting the
__GL_GSYNC_ALLOWED environment variable to 0 disables G-SYNC.
Setting it to 1 allows G-SYNC to be used when possible.</p>
<p>When G-SYNC is active and __GL_SYNC_TO_VBLANK is disabled,
applications rendering faster than the maximum refresh rate will
tear. This eliminates tearing for frame rates below the monitor's
maximum refresh rate while minimizing latency for frame rates above
it. When __GL_SYNC_TO_VBLANK is enabled, the frame rate is limited
to the monitor's maximum refresh rate to eliminate tearing
completely.</p>
<p>G-SYNC cannot be used when workstation stereo or workstation
overlays are enabled, or when there is more than one X screen. In
addition, G-SYNC cannot be used when an SLI mode other than Mosaic
is enabled.</p>
<p><a name="disableexecmem" id="disableexecmem"></a></p>
<h3>Disabling executable memory optimizations</h3>
<p>By default, the NVIDIA driver will attempt to use optimizations
which rely on being able to write to executable memory. This may
cause problems in certain system configurations (e.g., on SELinux
when the "allow_execmem" boolean is disabled or "deny_execmem"
boolean is enabled, and on grsecurity kernels configured with
CONFIG_PAX_MPROTECT). When possible, the driver will attempt to
detect when it is running on an unsupported configuration and
disable these optimizations automatically. If the
__GL_WRITE_TEXT_SECTION environment variable is set to 0, the
driver will unconditionally disable these optimizations.</p>
<h3>Ignoring GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) extension checks</h3>
<p>Some applications may use GLSL shaders that reference global
variables defined only in an OpenGL extension without including a
corresponding #extension directive in their source code.
Additionally, some applications may use GLSL shaders version 150 or
greater that reference global variables defined in a compatibility
profile, without specifying that a compatibility profile should be
used in their #version directive. Setting the
__GL_IGNORE_GLSL_EXT_REQS environment variable to 1 will cause the
driver to ignore this class of errors, which may allow these
shaders to successfully compile.</p>

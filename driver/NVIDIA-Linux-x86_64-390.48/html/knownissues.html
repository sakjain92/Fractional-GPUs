<p>There are some issues with older versions of the glibc dynamic
loader (e.g., the version that shipped with Red Hat Linux 7.2) and
applications such as Quake3 and Radiant, that use dlopen(). See

<p>Single-threaded applications that use dlopen() to load NVIDIA's

"term">The X86-64 platform (AMD64/EM64T) and early Linux 2.6
kernels</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Early Linux 2.6 x86_64 kernels have an accounting problem in
their implementation of the change_page_attr kernel interface.
These kernels include a check that triggers a BUG() when this
situation is encountered (triggering a BUG() results in the current
application being killed by the kernel; this application would be
your OpenGL application or potentially the X server). The
accounting issue has been resolved in the 2.6.11 kernel.</p>
<p>We have added checks to recognize that the NVIDIA kernel module
is being compiled for the x86-64 platform on a kernel between Linux
2.6.0 and Linux 2.6.11. In this case, we will disable usage of the
change_page_attr kernel interface. This will avoid the accounting
issue but leaves the system in danger of cache aliasing (see entry
below on Cache Aliasing for more information about cache aliasing).
Note that this change_page_attr accounting issue and BUG() can be
triggered by other kernel subsystems that rely on this
interface.</p>
<p>If you are using a Linux 2.6 x86_64 kernel, it is recommended
that you upgrade to Linux 2.6.11 or to a later kernel.</p>
<p>Also take note of common dma issues on 64-bit platforms in
<a href="dma_issues.html" title=
"Chapter&nbsp;10.&nbsp;Allocating DMA Buffers on 64-bit Platforms">Chapter&nbsp;10,
<i>Allocating DMA Buffers on 64-bit Platforms</i></a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Cache Aliasing</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Cache aliasing occurs when multiple mappings to a physical page
of memory have conflicting caching states, such as cached and
uncached. Due to these conflicting states, data in that physical
page may become corrupted when the processor's cache is flushed. If
that page is being used for DMA by a driver such as NVIDIA's
graphics driver, this can lead to hardware stability problems and
system lockups.</p>
<p>NVIDIA has encountered bugs with some Linux kernel versions that
lead to cache aliasing. Although some systems will run perfectly
fine when cache aliasing occurs, other systems will experience
severe stability problems, including random lockups. Users
experiencing stability problems due to cache aliasing will benefit
from updating to a kernel that does not cause cache aliasing to
occur.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">64-Bit BARs (Base Address
Registers)</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>NVIDIA GPUs advertise a 64-bit BAR capability (a Base Address
Register stores the location of a PCI I/O region, such as registers
or a frame buffer). This means that the GPU's PCI I/O regions
(registers and frame buffer) can be placed above the 32-bit address
space (the first 4 gigabytes of memory).</p>
<p>The decision of where the BAR is placed is made by the system
BIOS at boot time. If the BIOS supports 64-bit BARs, then the
NVIDIA PCI I/O regions may be placed above the 32-bit address
space. If the BIOS does not support this feature, then our PCI I/O
regions will be placed within the 32-bit address space as they have
always been.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some Linux kernels (such as 2.6.11.x) do not
understand or support 64-bit BARs. If the BIOS does place any
NVIDIA PCI I/O regions above the 32-bit address space, such kernels
will reject the BAR and the NVIDIA driver will not work.</p>
<p>The only known workaround is to upgrade to a newer kernel.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a name="kva_exhaustion" id="kva_exhaustion"></a><span class=
"term">Kernel virtual address space exhaustion on the X86
platform</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>On X86 systems and AMD64/EM64T systems using X86 kernels, only
4GB of virtual address space are available, which the Linux kernel
typically partitions such that user processes are allocated 3GB,
the kernel itself 1GB. Part of the kernel's share is used to create
a direct mapping of system memory (RAM). Depending on how much
system memory is installed, the kernel virtual address space
remaining for other uses varies in size and may be as small as
128MB, if 1GB of system memory (or more) are installed. The kernel
typically reserves a minimum of 128MB by default.</p>
<p>The kernel virtual address space still available after the
creation of the direct system memory mapping is used by both the
kernel and by drivers to map I/O resources, and for some memory
allocations. Depending on the number of consumers and their
respective requirements, the Linux kernel's virtual address space
may be exhausted. Typically when this happens, the kernel prints an
error message that looks like</p>
<pre class="screen">
allocation failed: out of vmalloc space - use vmalloc=&lt;size&gt; to increase size.
</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre class="screen">
vmap allocation for size 16781312 failed: use vmalloc=&lt;size&gt; to increase size.
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>The NVIDIA kernel module requires portions of the kernel's
virtual address space for each GPU and for certain memory
allocations. If no more than 128MB are available to the kernel and
device drivers at boot time, the NVIDIA kernel module may be unable
to initialize all GPUs, or fail memory allocations. This is not
usually a problem with only 1 or 2 GPUs, however depending on the
number of other drivers and their usage patterns, it can be; it is
likely to be a problem with 3 or more GPUs.</p>
<p>Possible solutions for this problem include:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>If your system is equipped with an X86-64 (AMD64/EM64T)
processor, it is recommended that you switch to a 64-bit Linux
kernel/distribution. Due to the significantly larger address space
provided by the X86-64 processors' addressing capabilities, X86-64
kernels will not run out of kernel virtual address space in the
foreseeable future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a 64-bit kernel cannot be used, the 'vmalloc' kernel
parameter can be used on recent kernels to increase the size of the
kernel virtual address space reserved by the Linux kernel (the
default is usually 128MB). Incrementally raising this to find the
best balance between the size of the kernel virtual address space
made available and the size of the direct system memory mapping is
recommended. You can achieve this by passing 'vmalloc=192M',
'vmalloc=256MB', ..., to the kernel and checking if the above error
message continues to be printed.</p>
<p>Note that some versions of the GRUB boot loader have problems
calculating the memory layout and loading the initrd if the
'vmalloc' kernel parameter is used. The 'uppermem' GRUB command can
be used to force GRUB to load the initrd into a lower region of
system memory to work around this problem. This will not adversely
affect system performance once the kernel has been loaded. The
suggested syntax (assuming GRUB version 1) is:</p>
<pre class="screen">
title     Kernel Title
uppermem  524288
kernel    (hdX,Y)/boot/vmlinuz...
</pre>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In some cases, disabling frame buffer drivers such as vesafb can
help, as such drivers may attempt to map all or a large part of the
installed graphics cards' video memory into the kernel's virtual
address space, which rapidly consumes this resource. You can
disable the vesafb frame buffer driver by passing these parameters
to the kernel: 'video=vesa:off vga=normal'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some Linux kernels can be configured with alternate address
space layouts (e.g. 2.8GB:1.2GB, 2GB:2GB, etc.). This option can be
used to avoid exhaustion of the kernel virtual address space
without reducing the size of the direct system memory mapping. Some
Linux distributors also provide kernels that use separate 4GB
address spaces for user processes and the kernel. Such Linux
kernels provide sufficient kernel virtual address space on typical
systems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Valgrind</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>The NVIDIA OpenGL implementation makes use of self modifying
code. To force Valgrind to retranslate this code after a
modification you must run using the Valgrind command line
option:</p>
<pre class="screen">
--smc-check=all
</pre>
<p>Without this option Valgrind may execute incorrect code causing
incorrect behavior and reports of the form:</p>
<pre class="screen">
==30313== Invalid write of size 4
</pre>
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">MMConfig-based PCI Configuration Space
Accesses</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>2.6 kernels have added support for Memory-Mapped PCI
Configuration Space accesses. Unfortunately, there are many
problems with this mechanism, and the latest kernel updates are
more careful about enabling this support.</p>
<p>The NVIDIA driver may be unable to reliably read/write the PCI
Configuration Space of NVIDIA devices when the kernel is using the
MMCONFIG method to access PCI Configuration Space, specifically
when using multiple GPUs and multiple CPUs on 32-bit kernels.</p>
<p>This access method can be identified by the presence of the
string "PCI: Using MMCONFIG" in the 'dmesg' output on your system.
This access method can be disabled via the "pci=nommconf" kernel
parameter.</p>

<dt><a name="alsa_infoframe_checksum" id=
"alsa_infoframe_checksum"></a><span class="term">HDMI screen blanks
unless audio is played</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>The ALSA audio driver in some Linux kernels contains a bug
affecting some systems with integrated graphics that causes the
display to go blank on some HDMI TVs whenever audio is not being
played. This bug occurs when the ALSA audio driver configures the
HDMI hardware to send an HDMI audio info frame that contains an
invalid checksum. Some TVs blank the video when they receive such
invalid audio packets.</p>
<p>To ensure proper display, please make sure your Linux kernel
contains commit 1f348522844bb1f6e7b10d50b9e8aa89a2511b09. This fix
is in Linux 2.6.39-rc3 and later, and may be be back-ported to some
older kernels.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a name="msi_interrupts" id="msi_interrupts"></a><span class=
"term">Driver fails to initialize when MSI interrupts are
enabled</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>The Linux NVIDIA driver uses Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI)
by default. This provides compatibility and scalability benefits,
mainly due to the avoidance of IRQ sharing.</p>
<p>Some systems have been seen to have problems supporting MSI,
while working fine with virtual wire interrupts. These problems
manifest as an inability to start X with the NVIDIA driver, or CUDA
initialization failures. The NVIDIA driver will then report an
error indicating that the NVIDIA kernel module does not appear to
be receiving interrupts generated by the GPU.</p>
<p>Problems have also been seen with suspend/resume while MSI is
enabled. All known problems have been fixed, but if you observe
problems with suspend/resume that you did not see with previous
drivers, disabling MSI may help you.</p>
<p>NVIDIA is working on a long-term solution to improve the
driver's out of the box compatibility with system configurations
that do not fully support MSI.</p>
<p>MSI interrupts can be disabled via the NVIDIA kernel module
parameter "NVreg_EnableMSI=0". This can be set on the command line
when loading the module, or more appropriately via your
distribution's kernel module configuration files (such as those
under /etc/modprobe.d/).</p>
</dd>
<dt><a name="console_restore" id="console_restore"></a><span class=
"term">Console restore behavior</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>The Linux NVIDIA driver uses the nvidia-modeset module for
console restore whenever it can. Currently, the improved console
restore mechanism is used on systems that boot with the UEFI
Graphics Output Protocol driver, and on systems that use supported
VESA linear graphical modes. Note that VGA text, color index,
planar, banked, and some linear modes cannot be supported, and will
use the older console restore method instead.</p>
<p>When the new console restore mechanism is in use and the
nvidia-modeset module is initialized (e.g. because an X server is
running on a different VT, nvidia-persistenced is running, or the
nvidia-drm module is loaded with the <code class=
"computeroutput">modeset=1</code> parameter), then nvidia-modeset
will respond to hot plug events by displaying the console on as
many displays as it can. Note that to save power, it may not
display the console on all connected displays.</p>

<dd>
<p>It is currently not possible to enumerate multiple devices if
one of them will be used to present to an X11 swapchain. It is
still possible to enumerate multiple devices even if one of them is
driving an X screen given that they will be used for Vulkan
offscreen rendering or presenting to a display swapchain. For that,
make sure that the application cannot open a display connection to
an X server by, for example, unsetting the DISPLAY environment
variable.</p>

<dd>
<p>Many games based on the Quake 3 engine set their textures to use
the <code class="computeroutput">GL_CLAMP</code> clamping mode when
they should be using <code class=
"computeroutput">GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE</code>. This was an oversight
made by the developers because some legacy NVIDIA GPUs treat the
two modes as equivalent. The result is seams at the edges of
textures in these games. To mitigate this, older versions of the
NVIDIA display driver remap <code class=
"computeroutput">GL_CLAMP</code> to <code class=
"computeroutput">GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE</code> internally to emulate the
behavior of the older GPUs, but this workaround has been disabled
by default. To re-enable it, uncheck the "Use Conformant Texture
Clamping" checkbox in nvidia-settings before starting any affected
applications.</p>

<dt><span class="term">FSAA</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>When FSAA is enabled (the __GL_FSAA_MODE environment variable is

</dd>
<dt><span class="term">libGL DSO finalizer and pthreads</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>When a multithreaded OpenGL application exits, it is possible
for libGL's DSO finalizer (also known as the destructor, or
"_fini") to be called while other threads are executing OpenGL
code. The finalizer needs to free resources allocated by libGL.
This can cause problems for threads that are still using these
resources. Setting the environment variable "__GL_NO_DSO_FINALIZER"
to "1" will work around this problem by forcing libGL's finalizer
to leave its resources in place. These resources will still be
reclaimed by the operating system when the process exits. Note that
the finalizer is also executed as part of dlclose(3), so if you
have an application that dlopens(3) and dlcloses(3) libGL
repeatedly, "__GL_NO_DSO_FINALIZER" will cause libGL to leak
resources until the process exits. Using this option can improve
stability in some multithreaded applications, including Java3D
applications.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Thread cancellation</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Canceling a thread (see pthread_cancel(3)) while it is executing
in the OpenGL driver causes undefined behavior. For applications
that wish to use thread cancellation, it is recommended that
threads disable cancellation using pthread_setcancelstate(3) while
executing OpenGL or GLX commands.</p>

<p>This section describes problems that will not be fixed. Usually,
the source of the problem is beyond the control of NVIDIA.
Following is the list of problems:</p>

<p class="title"><b>Problems that Will Not Be Fixed</b></p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="term">NV-CONTROL versions 1.8 and 1.9</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Version 1.8 of the NV-CONTROL X Extension introduced target
types for setting and querying attributes as well as receiving
event notification on targets. Targets are objects like X Screens,
GPUs and Quadro Sync devices. Previously, all attributes were
described relative to an X Screen. These new bits of information
(target type and target id) were packed in a non-compatible way in
the protocol stream such that addressing X Screen 1 or higher would
generate an X protocol error when mixing NV-CONTROL client and
server versions.</p>
<p>This packing problem has been fixed in the NV-CONTROL 1.10
protocol, making it possible for the older (1.7 and prior) clients
to communicate with NV-CONTROL 1.10 servers. Furthermore, the
NV-CONTROL 1.10 client library has been updated to accommodate the
target protocol packing bug when communicating with a 1.8 or 1.9
NV-CONTROL server. This means that the NV-CONTROL 1.10 client
library should be able to communicate with any version of the
NV-CONTROL server.</p>
<p>NVIDIA recommends that NV-CONTROL client applications relink
with version 1.10 or later of the NV-CONTROL client library
(libXNVCtrl.a, in the nvidia-settings-390.48.tar.bz2 tarball).
The version of the client library can be determined by checking the
NV_CONTROL_MAJOR and NV_CONTROL_MINOR definitions in the
accompanying nv_control.h.</p>
<p>The only web released NVIDIA Linux driver that is affected by
this problem (i.e., the only driver to use either version 1.8 or
1.9 of the NV-CONTROL X extension) is 1.0-8756.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">CPU throttling reducing memory bandwidth on
IGP systems</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>For some models of CPU, the CPU throttling technology may affect
not only CPU core frequency, but also memory frequency/bandwidth.
On systems using integrated graphics, any reduction in memory
bandwidth will affect the GPU as well as the CPU. This can
negatively affect applications that use significant memory
bandwidth, such as video decoding using VDPAU, or certain OpenGL
operations. This may cause such applications to run with lower
performance than desired.</p>
<p>To work around this problem, NVIDIA recommends configuring your
CPU throttling implementation to avoid reducing memory bandwidth.
This may be as simple as setting a certain minimum frequency for
the CPU.</p>
<p>Depending on your operating system and/or distribution, this may
be as simple as writing to a configuration file in the /sys or
/proc filesystems, or other system configuration file. Please read,
or search the Internet for, documentation regarding CPU throttling
on your operating system.</p>

<p>If VDPAU gives the VDP_STATUS_NO_IMPLEMENTATION error message on

the GPU to the manufacturer for a replacement.</p>

<p>The NVIDIA Linux driver supports configuring various driver
settings on a per-process basis through the use of "application
profiles": collections of settings that are only applied if the
current process matches attributes detected by the driver when it
is loaded into the process. This mechanism allows users to
selectively override global driver settings for a particular
application without the need to set environment variables on the
command line prior to running the application.</p>
<p>Application profiles consist of "rules" and "profiles". A
"profile" defines what settings to use, and a "rule" identifies an
application and defines what profile should be used with that
application.</p>
<p>A rule identifies an application by describing various features
of the application; for example, the name of the application binary
(e.g. "glxgears") or a shared library loaded into the application
(e.g. "libpthread.so.0"). The particular features supported by this
NVIDIA Linux implementation are listed below in the "Supported
Features" section.</p>
<p>Currently, application profiles are only supported by the NVIDIA
Linux GLX implementation, but other NVIDIA driver components may
use them in the future.</p>
<p>Application profiles can be configured using the nvidia-settings
control panel. To learn more, consult the online help text by
clicking the "Help" button under the "Application Profiles" page in
nvidia-settings.</p>

Application Profiles in the OpenGL Driver</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Note: if HOME is unset, then any configuration files listed
below located under $HOME will not be loaded by the driver.</p>
<p>To enable application profile support globally on a system, edit
the file $HOME/.nv/nvidia-application-profile-globals-rc to contain
a JSON object with a member "enabled" set to true or false. For
example, if this file contains the following string:</p>
<pre class="screen">
{ "enabled" : true }
</pre>
<p>application profiles will be enabled globally in the driver. If
this file does not exist or cannot be read by the parser,
application profiles will be enabled by default.</p>
<p>Application profile support in the driver can be toggled for an
individual application by using the __GL_APPLICATION_PROFILE
environment variable. Setting this to 1 enables application profile
support, and setting this to 0 disables application profile
support. If this environment variable is set, this overrides any
setting specified in
$HOME/.nv/nvidia-application-profile-globals-rc.</p>
<p>Additionally, the application profile parser can log debugging
information to stderr if the __GL_APPLICATION_PROFILE_LOG
environment variable is set to 1. Conversely, setting
__GL_APPLICATION_PROFILE_LOG to 0 disables logging of parse
information to stderr.</p>

Profile Search Path</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>By default, when the driver component ("libGL.so.1" in the case
of GLX) is loaded by a process, the driver looks for files in the
following search path:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p><code class=
"filename">$HOME/.nv/nvidia-application-profiles-rc</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code class=
"filename">$HOME/.nv/nvidia-application-profiles-rc.d</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code class=
"filename">/etc/nvidia/nvidia-application-profiles-rc</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code class=
"filename">/etc/nvidia/nvidia-application-profiles-rc.d</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code class=
"filename">/usr/share/nvidia/nvidia-application-profiles-390.48-rc</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>By convention, the <code class="filename">*-rc.d</code> files
are directories and the <code class="filename">*-rc</code> files
are regular files, but the driver places no restrictions on file
type, and any of the above files can be a directory or regular
file, or a symbolic link which resolves to a directory or regular
file. Files of other types (e.g. character or block devices,
sockets, and named pipes) will be ignored.</p>
<p>If a file in the search path is a directory, the parser will
examine all regular files (or symbolic links which resolve to
regular files) in that directory in alphanumeric order, as
determined by strcoll(3). Files in the directory of other types
(e.g. other directories, character or block devices, sockets, and
named pipes) will be ignored.</p>

File Syntax</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>When application profiles are enabled in the driver, the driver
configuration is defined by a set of <span class=
"emphasis"><em>profiles</em></span> and <span class=
"emphasis"><em>rules</em></span>. Profiles are collections of
driver settings given as key/value pairs, and rules are mappings
between one or more <span class="emphasis"><em>patterns</em></span>
which match against some feature of the process and a profile.</p>
<p>Configuration files are written in a superset of JSON (<a href=
"http://www.json.org/" target="_top">http://www.json.org/</a>) with
the following additional features:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>A hash mark ('#') appearing outside of a JSON string denotes a
comment, and any text appearing between the hash mark and the end
of the line inclusively is ignored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integers can be specified in base 8 or 16, in addition to base
10. Numbers beginning with '0' and followed by a digit are
interpreted to be octal, and numbers beginning with '0' and
followed by 'x' or 'X' are interpreted to be hexadecimal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>Each file consists of a root object with two optional
members:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>"rules", which contains an array of rules, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"profiles", which contains an array of profiles.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Each rule is an object with the following members:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>"pattern", which contains either a string, a pattern object, or
an array of zero or more pattern objects. If a string is given, it
is interpreted to be a pattern object with the "feature" member set
to "procname" and the "matches" member set to the value of the
string. During application detection, the driver determines if each
pattern in the rule matches the running process, and only applies
the rule if all patterns in the rule match. If an empty array is
given, the rule is unconditionally applied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"profile", which contains either a string, array, or profile. If
a string is given, it is interpreted to be the name of some profile
in the configuration. If a profile is given, it is implicitly
defined as part of the rule. If an array is given, the array is
interpreted to be an inline profile with its "settings" member set
to the contents of the array.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Each profile is an object with the following members:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>"name", a string which names the profile for use in a rule. This
member is mandatory if the profile is specified as part of the root
object's profiles array, but optional if the profile is defined
inline as part of a rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"settings", an array of settings which can be given in two
different formats:</p>
<div class="orderedlist">
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>As an array of keys and values, e.g.</p>
<pre class="screen">
[ "key1", "value1", "key2", 3.14159, "key3", 0xF00D ]
</pre>
<p>Keys must be specified as strings, while a value may be a
string, number, or true/false.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as an array of JSON setting objects.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Each setting object contains the following members:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>"k" (or "key"), the key given as a string</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"v" (or "value"), the value, given as a string, number, or
true/false.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>A pattern object may consist of a pattern primitive, or a
logical operation on pattern objects. A pattern primitive is an
object containing the following members:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>"feature", the feature to match the pattern against. Supported
features are listed in the "Supported Features" section below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"matches", the string to match.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>A pattern operation is an object containing the following
members:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>"op", a string describing the logical operation to apply to the
subpatterns. Valid values are "and", "or", or "not".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"sub": a pattern object or array of one or more pattern objects,
to serve as the operands. Note that the "not" operator expects
exactly one object; any other number of objects will cause the
pattern to fail to match.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>If the pattern is an operation, then the pattern matches if and
only if the logical operation applied to the subpatterns is true.
For example,</p>
<pre class="screen">
    {
        "op" : "or",
        "sub" : [ { "feature" : "procname", "matches" : "foo" },
                  { "feature" : "procname", "matches" : "bar" } ]
    }
</pre>
<p>matches all processes with the name "foo" *or* "bar".
Similarly,</p>
<pre class="screen">
    {
        "op" : "and",
        "sub" : [ { "feature" : "procname", "matches" : "foo" },
                  { "feature" : "dso", "matches" : "bar.so" } ]
    }
</pre>
<p>matches all processes with the name "foo" that load DSO
"bar.so", and</p>
<pre class="screen">
    {
        "op" : "not",
        "sub" : { "feature" : "procname", "matches" : "foo" }
    }
</pre>
<p>matches a process which is *not* named "foo". Nested operations
are possible; for example:</p>
<pre class="screen">
    {
        "op" : "and",
        "sub" : [
            { "feature" : "dso", "matches" : "foo.so" },
            { "op" : "not", "sub" : { "feature" : "procname", "matches" : "bar" } }
         ]
    }
</pre>
<p>matches processes that are *not* named "bar" that load DSO
"foo.so".</p>

</div>
<p>Profiles may be specified in any order, and rules defined in
files earlier in the search path may refer to profiles defined
later in the search path.</p>
<p>Rules are prioritized based on the order in which they are
defined: each rule has precedence over rules defined after it in
the same file, and rules defined in a file have precedence over
rules defined in files that come after that file in the search
path.</p>
<p>For example, if there are two files A and B, such that A comes
before B in the search path, with the following contents:</p>
<pre class="screen">
    # File A
    {
        "rules" : [ { "pattern" : "foo",
                      "profile" : [ "a", 1 ] },
                    { "pattern" : "foo",
                      "profile" : [ "a", 0, "b", 2 ] } ]

<p>and the driver is loaded into a process with the name "foo", it
will apply the settings "a" = 1, "b" = 2, and "c" = 3.</p>
<p>Settings specified via application profiles have higher
precedence than global settings specified in nvidia-settings, but
lower precedence than settings specified directly via environment
variables.</p>

Features</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This NVIDIA Linux driver supports detection of the following
features:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>"true": patterns using this feature will always match,
regardless of the contents of the string provided by "matches".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"procname": patterns using this feature compare the string
provided by "matches" against the pathname of the current process
with the leading directory components removed and match if they are
equal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"dso": patterns using this feature compare the string provided
by "matches" against the list of currently loaded libraries in the
current process and match if the string matches one of the entries
in the list (with leading directory components removed).</p>
<p>Please note that application detection occurs when the driver
component ("libGL.so.1" in the case of GLX) is first loaded by a
process, so a pattern using this feature may fail to match if the
library specified by the pattern is loaded after the component is
loaded. A potential workaround for this on Linux is to set the
LD_PRELOAD environment variable (see ld-linux(8)) to include the
component, as in the following example:</p>
<pre class="screen">
    LD_PRELOAD="libGL.so.1" glxgears
</pre>
<p>Note this defeats one of the objectives of application detection
(namely the need to set environment variables on the command line
before running the application), but this may be useful when there
is a need to frequently change driver settings for a particular
application: one can write a wrapper script to set LD_PRELOAD once,
then modify the JSON configuration repeatedly without needing to
edit the wrapper script later on.</p>
<p>Also note that the pattern matches against library names as they
appear in the maps file of that process (see proc(5)), and not the
names of symbolic links to these libraries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"findfile": patterns using this feature should provide a
colon-separated list of filenames in the "matches" argument. At
runtime, the driver scans the directory of the process executable
and matches the pattern if every file specified in this list is
present in the same directory. Please note there is currently no
support for matching against files in other paths than the process
executable directory.</p>

<p>"EGLVisibleDGPUDevices"</p>
<p>On a multi-device system, this option can be used to make EGL
ignore certain devices. This setting takes a 32-bit mask encoding a
whitelist of visible devices. The bit position matches the minor
number of the device to make visible.</p>
<p>For instance, the profile</p>
<pre class="screen">
    {
        "rules" : [
            { "pattern" : [],
              "profile" : [ "EGLVisibleDGPUDevices", 0x00000002 ] }
        ]
    }
                
</pre>
<p>would only make the device with minor number 1 visible (i.e.
/dev/nvidia1).</p>
</li>

<p>"EGLVisibleTegraDevices" : Same semantics as
EGLVisibleDGPUDevices</p>

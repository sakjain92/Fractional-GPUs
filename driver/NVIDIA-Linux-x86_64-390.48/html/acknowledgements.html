<p>The self-extracting archive (also known as the <code class=
"filename">.run</code> file) is generated using <code class=
"filename">makeself.sh</code>: <a href=
"http://www.megastep.org/makeself/" target=
"_top">http://www.megastep.org/makeself/</a></p>
<p>The version of makeself.sh used to create the .run is bundled
within the .run file, and can retrieved by extracting the .run
file's contents, e.g.:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-390.48.run --extract-only
$ ls -l NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-390.48/makeself.sh
